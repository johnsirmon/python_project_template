This repository serves as a template for Python projects, providing a standardized structure and setup process. It includes essential configuration files and a basic directory layout to kickstart your Python development.

## Pre-Setup Requirements

Before you begin setting up this project, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- Conda is installed on your system. [Install Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) if you haven't already.
- Conda must be added to your system's PATH environment variable. [Manage PATH](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#setting-environment-variables).
- For Windows users, administrative privileges are required to run the setup script. To do this, right-click on the Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator".


## Project Structure

- `src/`: Main source code for the project. This is where your application logic resides.
- `tests/`: Test scripts for the project to ensure code quality and reliability.
- `data/`: Data files used or generated by the project, such as datasets or input files.
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project, including setup instructions and usage guides.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experiments, analysis, and prototyping.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.
- `.env.example`: Template for environment variables.
- `setup_env.bat`/`setup_env.sh`: Script to set up the project environment.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies untracked files to ignore, customizable for your project's needs.
- `README.md`: Overview and setup instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johnsirmon/python_project_template.git
cd python_project_template

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Run the `setup_env.bat` script to create the Conda environment and set up the project structure:

```bash
setup_env.bat # For Windows
# or
setup_env.sh # For Unix/Linux

This script will:
- Check for Conda installation (assumes Conda is in PATH).
- Prompt for the Python version, allowing flexibility.
- Create and activate a Conda environment (default name `myenv`, replaceable with preferred name).
- Check for the existence of `.env.example` and `requirements.txt`, providing warnings if not found.
- Create the necessary project directories.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for environment variable setup.
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.


### Configuring Environment Variables

- Copy the contents from `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`.
- Modify the `.env` file to include your specific environment variables.

### Installing Dependencies

- Ensure your Conda environment is activated.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages.

### Version Control Best Practices

- Regularly update `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files from your repository.
- Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to keep your dependencies up-to-date.

### Tips for Beginners

- **src/**: Place all your Python source files here. This is the heart of your project.
- **tests/**: Write tests for your code here. Testing is crucial for long-term project maintenance.
- **data/**: Use this directory for any data files your project uses or produces.
- **docs/**: Document your project's setup, usage, and any additional information here.
- **notebooks/**: Great for prototyping and data analysis. If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, the above link is a helpful start.


### Notes

### Notes

- Users might need to adjust file paths in the scripts or project structure if they are different from the standard layout.
- Ensure administrative privileges when running the `setup_env.bat` or `setup_env.sh` script, especially on Windows.
- Adjust file paths in the scripts or project structure as needed if they differ from the standard layout.
- For Git-related operations, make sure Git is installed on your system. [Git Setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
